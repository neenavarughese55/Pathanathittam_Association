Pathanamthitta Tourist page design report 

I created a tourist page for my hometown in South India. I first created a home page and focused on how to make it as eye-catching as possible. How I executed that was by instead of the image taking up the whole width of the page, the image took up half of the page and title was on the other side. This had taken me awhile to achieve as the title was not positioning at the center of the other side.

As for the title after adding the double border and green background with a png palm tree image on the right hand side of the title I got inspired to consistently carry out the same design for the headings for the history and visit page.

Continuing on I included in a secondary header with the slogan and found date of the town as well as a text box including general information about Pathanamthitta but this time taking up the full width but when I inputted the width to be 100% the text box overlapped the whole banner to the right so I had to enter a more precise percentage to achieve the perfect alignment between the banner and the text box.

Beneath the text box, I had added the map of the location of Pathanamthitta and implemented it to be in the center of the page, but I had trouble moving the hyperlink beneath the map to show the larger map which takes you to the open street map website; to the center so I left it at the right hand side of the page. 

Moving onto the History page I had done the same exact design for the title as I did for the home page but this time positioned the title to be in the center of the page.

I included a text box beneath the title consisting of information on the history of Pathanamthitta. While recreating the half image and half text as I did for the homepage banner, but this time including more information about the history of Pathanamthitta instead of the title. The text box was again hard to position as I had trouble moving it beside the image and aligning correctly but eventually managed.

Lastly for the visit page I designed the title same as the other pages but this time a different background colour. 

I implemented in css and html to achieve the 7:5 column ratio but including a 7 part column on the left hand side of the page and 5 part column on the right hand side of the page using bootstrap and coloured them two different colours as to why the title was a different colour from the previous titles. 

Originally I had included the text in the 7 part column and the corresponding images to the text on the 5 part column but the page felt very empty so I placed the text and image in each column in an alternative format but this had caused the issue of the image and it’s text not aligning well however the page looked a lot less empty so I still proceeded and tried to sort out the alignment but it is still a bit off. I underlined the headings for each column.

Next I added a learn more button below the image, which once you click the button it leads you to a website which goes into more detail about the place. The button felt a little out of place and empty so I added a coloured background to the colour of the column next to it and positioned the button to overlap the background. Although I felt the design looked much better I had issues shortening the buttons width and aligning the image to the text again. 

As for Navigation I used the same button design as I did for the learn more button used in the visit page. 

The colour scheme was decided by the view of nature in the images which I found online whenever I searched up Pathanamthitta. The shades of green reminded me of the trees and plants, the grey reminded me of the stone and the brown reminded me of the colour of the huts also the trees branches/trunk
