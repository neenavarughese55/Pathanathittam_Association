# Pathanathittam_Association

I developed a tourist page for my hometown in South India, with a primary focus on creating an engaging and visually appealing homepage. To achieve this, I implemented a layout where an image occupies half of the page, while the title resides on the other half. Ensuring precise alignment of the title proved to be a meticulous task but was eventually achieved. Additionally, I incorporated a wooden background image to evoke an authentic essence throughout the website.

For the title section, I employed a double border, a green background(#4d6e5b), and a PNG palm tree image to enhance visual interest. This design inspiration was consistently applied to the headings across the history and visit pages.

The secondary header featured the town's slogan and founding date, accompanied by a text box containing general information about Pathanamthitta. However, adjusting the width of the text box to take up the full width of the page required precision to maintain perfect alignment with the banner.

Underneath the text box, a map depicting Pathanamthitta's location was positioned at the center of the page. Challenges arose when attempting to position the hyperlink beneath the map, leading to a larger map on the OpenStreetMap website. As a resolution, the hyperlink was placed on the right-hand side of the page.

Transitioning to the History page, a similar design approach was adopted for the title, albeit positioned centrally. A text box below the title provided insights into the town's history, employing a format akin to the homepage. Despite initial challenges in positioning the text box beside the image, alignment issues were eventually resolved.

On the Visit page, the title design mirrored that of previous pages but with a different background colour (#555).

To achieve a visually appealing layout, a 7:5 column ratio was implemented using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, with the left-hand side divided into a 7-part column and the right-hand side into a 5-part column. Differentiating colours (#44a3439a & #4d6e5b) were applied to delineate sections, explaining the variation in the title's colour.

Originally, text was placed in the 7-part column with corresponding images in the 5-part column. However, to address perceived emptiness, a reorganisation was implemented, resulting in alignment challenges between images and text.

A "Learn More" button was introduced below images, providing users with access to detailed information about the destination. Enhancements were made by giving the button a coloured background matching adjacent columns, though adjustments were required to ensure optimal width and alignment.

Navigation was facilitated through consistent button design, echoing the aesthetics of the "Learn More" button. Font-family consistency was maintained across text boxes and information sections, employing 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', and sans-serif fonts.

The colour scheme was meticulously chosen to reflect the natural beauty of Pathanamthitta, with shades of green evoking lush foliage, grey symbolising stone, and brown reminiscent of traditional huts and tree branches/trunk.
