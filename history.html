    <h1> History of Pathanamthitta </h1>
    <p> From the 9th through the 12th centuries, Thiruvalla Taluk in Pathanathitta was a component of Nantuzhainad, which then merged with Odanad and finally became Thekkumkur. The district has had literary and cultural growth over this time. The district of Pathanamthitta was previously ruled by the Pandalams, who had some ties to the Pandya Kingdom. Following Pandalam's 1820 union with Travancore, the region was placed under Travancore's governance.</p>
    <p>Historically, Pathanamthitta held great significance within Travancore, serving as the largest taluk in the erstwhile Travancore state. The revenue generated from this taluk played a pivotal role in sustaining the state's finances. </p>
    <p> An important factor in the Indian Independence movement was Pathanamthitta. Known Pathanamthitta independence warriors include Shri. K.E. Manam and Shri. K.A. Mathew. In 1982, Pathanamthitta became a distinct district. It was created by joining parts of the districts of Idukki, Kollam, and Alappuzha.</p>
